            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p>"You don’t woo me!"</p>

            <p>That’s what my wife said to me several years ago. After an intense long debate, I realized that I wanted to woo her, but I didn’t know what to do. That’s when I thought of the app. At the time, I was like most people, stuck in the cycle of doing the same ole thing – flowers, dinners, movies. During this time, I also realized I had a deeper need to connect with men who could support me in my relationship with my wife. I was lucky to find an organization of men and women whose purpose is to help families thrive together. It was there I met my business partner who had similar challenges. After a brief survey of both men and women we understood that both parties struggled to woo their partners. This was a large reason why the excitement in their relationships waned.</p>
              
            <p>I saw this first hand as I watched six of my closest friends get divorced. To be honest, I was upset, but not at them. I was upset at myself because I felt like there was something I could’ve said or done that could’ve inspired them to stick it out. Consequently, I became passionate about seeing couples succeed. I’m not perfect at this relationship thing but I desperately want to win at it. We launched this company with the goal of building a community of like-minded people. Our mission is to help equip you with the tools you need to have meaningful, long-lasting, and satisfying connections. We invite you to take this journey with us.</p>
              
            <p>One family. One community. One date at a time.</p>
              
            <p>Peace,</p>
            <p>The Founders</p>
